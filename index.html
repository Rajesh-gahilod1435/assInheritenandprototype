        Q1.	Create 2 objects - parent and child. Attach methods to parent and use those methods in child object using parents prototype																									

function Parent(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Parent.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
};

function Child(name, age) {
 
  Parent.call(this, name);
  this.age = age;
}
Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);
Child.prototype.constructor = Child;
Child.prototype.introduce = function () {
  console.log(`I am ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
}
const parent = new Parent("John");
const child = new Child("Alice", 5);


parent.greet(); 
child.greet();  
child.introduce();
In this example, we define a Parent constructor function with a
 greet method attached to its prototype. Then, we create a Child constructor
  function that inherits from Parent. The Child constructor calls the Parent 
  constructor using Parent.call(this, name) to set the name property and inherits 
  the greet method through the prototype chain. We also attach an introduce 
  method to the Child prototype.

Finally, we create instances of both Parent and Child and call
 their respective methods to demonstrate the inheritance.

        Q2.	Write code to explain prototype chaining																									

        Prototype chaining in JavaScript is the mechanism by which objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype objects. To explain prototype chaining,


function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.sayHello = function () {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
};

function Student(name, studentId) {
  Person.call(this, name);
  this.studentId = studentId;
}

Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Student.prototype.constructor = Student;

Student.prototype.study = function () {
  console.log(`${this.name} is studying with student ID ${this.studentId}`);
};

const person = new Person("John");
const student = new Student("Alice", 12345);

person.sayHello();   
student.sayHello();  
student.study();

        Q3.	Add a method to calculate sum of all elements in Array in array's protype, use that method to calculate sum for multiple arrays																									

      
Array.prototype.sum = function () {
  return this.reduce((total, current) => total + current, 0);
};

const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const array2 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
const array3 = [5, 10, 15, 20];

const sum1 = array1.sum(); 
const sum2 = array2.sum(); 
const sum3 = array3.sum(); 

console.log(`Sum of array1 elements: ${sum1}`);
console.log(`Sum of array2 elements: ${sum2}`);
console.log(`Sum of array3 elements: ${sum3}`);

We add a sum method to the Array prototype. This method uses the reduce function to iterate through the array and calculate the sum of its elements.

We create three arrays: array1, array2, and array3.

We use the sum method on each of these arrays to calculate the sum of their elements and store the results in sum1, sum2, and sum3.

Finally, we log the sums to the console.

        Q4.	Write a JavaScript function to retrieve all the names of object's own and inherited properties.																									

        function getAllPropertyNames(obj) {
            const properties = [];
          
            let currentObj = obj;
            while (currentObj) {
              properties.push(...Object.getOwnPropertyNames(currentObj));
              currentObj = Object.getPrototypeOf(currentObj);
            }
          
            return Array.from(new Set(properties));
          }
          
          const person = {
            name: "John",
            age: 30,
          };
          
          const student = Object.create(person);
          student.studentId = 12345;
          
          const allPropertyNames = getAllPropertyNames(student);
          console.log(allPropertyNames);
          


        The getAllPropertyNames function takes an object obj as an argument.

Inside the function, we initialize an empty array properties to store the property names.

We use a while loop to iterate through the object and its prototype chain. 
In each iteration, we use Object.getOwnPropertyNames to get the property names of the current 
object and push them into the properties array.

We then move up the prototype chain by setting currentObj to the prototype
 of the current object using Object.getPrototypeOf.

We continue this process until we reach the end of the prototype chain 
(i.e., when currentObj becomes null).

Finally, we remove duplicates from the properties array by converting 
it to a Set and then back to an array
